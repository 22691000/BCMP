This is the repository containing the code for E. Breza, A. Chandrasekhar, T. McCormick, and M. Pan "Using aggregated relational data to feasibly identify network structure without network data."

Files:
main.R - main algorithm described in Algorithm 1 in the paper

latent_surface_model.R - algorithm in McCormick, T. H. and T. Zheng(2015): "Latent surface models for networks usingAggregated Relational Data."

example.R - example of how to use the function in main.R. However, notice that we cannot provide the actual data we worked on, so this file is a demonstration that cannot be executed.
